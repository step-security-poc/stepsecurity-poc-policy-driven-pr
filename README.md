# Policy Driven PR's – Automating Fixes with Pull Requests 
 
Policy Driven PR's allow you to automate security remediation across your repositories by either automatically generating Pull Requests to fix issues or creating GitHub Issues to track vulnerabilities. For more information, see [here](https://docs.stepsecurity.io/orchestrate-security/policy-driven-prs) 

## How it works

Policy Driven PR's allow you to define specific controls and best practices to automate via pull requests. This can be enabled from the StepSecurity dashboard under `Orchestrate Security -> Policy Driven PR's`. The policy can be applied to individually to repositories, or all repositories. 

For the purpose of testing this in a POC, you can choose to turn this on for your own internal repositories, or use this repository as a reference

## Testing Controls 

This Repository contains a workflow with low scoring actions.
